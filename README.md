# Snake Game

A simple Snake game implemented using Python and Tkinter. The objective of the game is to control the snake to eat the food while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats the food, it grows longer, and the game becomes progressively harder.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
- Playable with keyboard arrows (Up, Down, Left, Right).
- The snake grows in size after eating the food.
- Game over when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- Score display.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
